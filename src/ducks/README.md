# What the Ducks!?

Ducks are a code organization/architectural [idea](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) based around colocating actions, reducers and side effects.

# What does this mean to me?

As a team we are attempting to utilize this pattern to bring both UI and data level state into [redux](https://redux.js.org/) using [flux standard actions](https://github.com/redux-utilities/flux-standard-action) and [redux sagas](https://redux-saga.js.org/)
